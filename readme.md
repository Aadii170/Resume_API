Resume API
This API provides a simple way for users to upload their resumes and retrieve them later when needed.

How it works:

Upload: A user uploads their resume file (PDF, DOCX, etc.) through the API.

Storage: The system securely stores the uploaded resume and generates a unique identifier (ID) for it.

Retrieve: Using this unique ID, the resume can be fetched or downloaded at any time.

This makes it easy to manage resumes in applications such as job portals, HR systems, or personal career tools without worrying about file management or storage complexities.
